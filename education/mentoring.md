## How it works

A more senior person hosts a more junior person and provides 
opportunity and mentoring:

Senior faculty/staff could offer projects for junior faculty/staff
  - for planning an experiment
  - drafting an MoU
  - budgeting a project
  - writing a grant application
  - develop a course
  - ...
  
The project should help the seniors as they would delegate some work,
and help the juniors as they gain experience.
There could be projects where no travel is required.

Any faculty, but especially junior faculty/postdocs , 
could offer projects for graduate students
  - measurement campaigns
  - design of test setups
  - building of test setups
  - prepare a lecture
  - write a paper
  - ...
  
The junior faculty gain experience in guiding people, planing and mentoring.
The graduate students learn something in a new research environment.
The length of the exchange should be between 3 and 9 months.

Graduate students could offer projects for under-graduate students. [the RISE model]
  - do some test measurements
  - help with building something
  - help with some programming
  - build a little something needed for the graduate work
  - ...
  
The graduate students gain experience in guiding people, planing and mentoring.
The under-graduate students learn something in a research environment.
The lengths of the exchange should be between 8 and 15 weeks.


Under-graduate students [with help from above] could offer projects for high-school students.
It is very good for the students to think about how to teach 15 to 18 years old.
