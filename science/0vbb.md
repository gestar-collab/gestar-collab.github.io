# Neutrinoless double beta decay

Radioactive decays are a well known phenomenon. In a beta decay, a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton emitting an electron and an anti-neutrino. Some nuclei cannot decay this way because the new nucleus would have more mass than the old one. In that case, two neutrons have to decay together, as shown in the following figure:

As it is hard for neutrons to communicate and agree on such a dead, such decays are extremely rare. However, they are considered normal and are observed. This can be done with germanium detectors. The GERDA and MAJORANA collaboration currently work with germanium detectors. The GERDA collaboration has published a value for the half-life for normal double beta decay in germanium of T(1/2) = (1.84 +0.14 -0.10) x 10^{21} years [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3210). This has to be compared to the age of the universe of "only" about 1.3 x 10^{10} years.

The observed decays show a spectrum of the energy of the two electrons which is compatible with two anti-neutrinos taking some of the energy released in the decay away. If no neutrinos would be emitted, all the energy would be carried by the electrons and all event would show exactly the same energy. The search for such a peak in the energy spectrum is the way to look for neutrinoless double beta decay. Such a decay is possible, if the neutrino is its own anti-particle. In this case, one neutron emits the anti-neutrino but the other neutron considers it a neutrino and absorbs it.

It would be a fundamental discovery to observe neutrinoless double beta decay. 
If the neutrino is its own anti-particle this could be part of the explanation why after the big bang some matter survived but no anti-matter. However, even if they can, it is much harder for two neutrons to match up properly to exchange a neutrino than to just decay together. Therefore, the decay rate is expected to be several orders of magnitude lower than for normal double  beta decay, i.e. the half-life is orders of magnitude larger. The best experimental limit in germanium has also been set by the GERDA collaboration as T(1/2) > 5.3 Â· 10^{25} years (90% C.L.) [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00570). 
In the future, the search is to be extended by several orders of magnitude. This will happen using large amounts of germanium and also xenon.

The research done within the framework of GEMARDARC will contribute to the better understanding of the germanium detectors used for the future germanium-based experiment LEGEND and will, thus, help to develop the concepts and strategies for this experiment.
Some members of the LEGEND collaboration are also members of GEMARDARC PIRE and provide opportunities to be part of this research.
