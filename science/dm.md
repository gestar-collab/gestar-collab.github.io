# Dark matter
There seems to be a lot more in the universe than can be seen. The normal matter that "our world" is made of seems to be only a small part of it. The first indication that the observed matter cannot be all there is came from the study of galaxy clusters: there is apparantly not enough matter to hold them together. The galaxies move about so fast that the clusters should disperse. 

Then came the observation that the stars at the edge of large spiral galaxies circle their galaxies too fast. This indicates that these galaxies have very massive halos which are invisible, i.e. "dark".

Stars move as fast at the edge of the galaxy as further in. They would be slower, 
if only the visible matter was there. 

And finally came the mapping of the dark masses with gravitational lensing.

In Einstein's description of gravity, any mass bends space-time. Thus, even the path of a massless particle like a photon, i.e. light, gets bent. This can result in observing the same object multiple times. 



A typical example of this phenomenon is an "Einstein cross".

Spectral analysis shows that the five images show the same object. A single object is sometimes seen as an arc or even as a complete ring. This depends on the distribution of the masses bending the light. 

Thus, the observation of multiple images of many far away objects makes it possible to estimate the amount and distribution of mass between the far away objects and us. It is like a gigantic puzzle. In the end, a three dimensional map of the dark universe emerges.

The amazing thing is that there is about five times more dark mass in the universe than there is normal mass.



Normally the dark mass is seen to surround the normal mass. However, one exception has been observed. The bullet cluster
is a very special case.

Two galaxy clusters collided and the visible matter interacted to form one cluster. The dark matter components of the two clusters  did not interact and separated again. They were mapped and are shown in blue. The normal matter is dominated by hot gas shown in pink. The bullet cluster is generally seen as THE evidence for dark mass.


As we cannot see this dark mass, we call whatever it is made of "dark matter". Particle physics provides a couple of hypothetical candiates for dark matter. One of them is the "weakly interacting massive particle", WIMP. This particular candidate has been searched for by many collaborations and in many ways. One approach is to place germanium detectors in a laboratory deep underground, protected from all natural radioactivity. In such an environment, a germanium detector does not produce background signals and it is possible to wait for the signal from an interaction of a WIMP in the crystal. So far, nobody has been able to identify such a signal. Thus, it is only possible to excludes WIMPs with certain masses and certain propabilities to interact.

Such exclusions only make sense, if we assume that dark matter is present around and in our earth. As the stars at the edge of our galaxy also move faster than the visible mass would suggest, this is believed to be a good assumption.

One of the experiments searching for WIMPs is the "China Dark Matter EXperiment", CDEX. Some Members of CDEX are also members of GEMADARK PIRE and visits are possible.
