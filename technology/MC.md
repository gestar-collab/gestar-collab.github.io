## GEARS
[GEARS][] is a [Geant4][] [Example][] Application with [Rich features](#features) yet Small footprint. The entire C++ coding is minimized down to a single file with about 550 [SLOC][]. This is achieved mainly by utilizing [Geant4][] plain [text geometry description][tg], [built-in UI commands][TUI] (macros), and C++ inheritance. It is ideal for student training and fast implementation of small to medium-sized experiments.

## MinGLE

[MinGLE][], a Mini [Geant4][] Learning Example, uses minimal C++ coding to demonstrate the usage of essential [Geant4][] components step by step. It is not tied to any specific experiment or third party library, which makes it a clean starting point of writing your own [Geant4][] applications.
